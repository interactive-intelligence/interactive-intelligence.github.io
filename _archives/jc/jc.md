# Journal Club

Collaborative Literature Exploration
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

**Legacy: This page is no longer up to date, but kept to preserve the content within it. However, Journal clubs still happen! Look in the Discord for more details.**

Journal Club meetings are held every week. See the schedules page for the most recent information on our schedules. JC meetings allow members to share, learn about, and discuss literature - both classic/foundational and novel/innovative - from neuroscience and artificial intelligence. See the JC meeting notes for resources and links to the presented literature and discussion.

## Soccer

| Date | Winning Team |
| --- | --- |
| 5/6 | Amelia, Andre, Roman* |
| 4/29 | Alec, Andre, Amelia |

*The victory is somewhat disputed because Andre probably guarded the goal too closely to be fair. However, in my defense, it was 5-2. That's pretty statistically significant.

## Weirdest Model Generated Results

*A language autoencoder generated self-censored genitalia.*

## Weirdest Performance Curves

*DLSM model: decides to spontaneously revert all progress and return to initial state at 2500 epochs.*

*DLSM model: tries to solve problem, gives up, tries again, does better.*

*DLSM model: can't pick between the extremes of language utilization.*

*DLSM model: chaotic overfitting at its finest. :)*

*DLSM model: creatively draws a lava moat and castle.*

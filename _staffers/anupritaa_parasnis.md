Education
{: .label .label-yellow}

Hey, I’m Anupritaa! I’m a sophomore at UW intending to major in Computer Science or ACMS. I’m interested in AI and its numerous applications, especially for helping people in need and in the medical field. I really enjoyed taking the Intro Course and learning about the interconnections between neuroscience and AI, so I decided to become a TA. Outside of school, I like reading, working out and playing piano!

I’m Chaytan, Team Captain at I2. I guess the first thing to know about me is that I love rain, trees, fungi, and plants, and they’re what made me want to form this team. I think that technology has enabled humans to destroy ourselves and organisms around us, but I’m hoping that the right technology can also enable us to reevaluate how we think and act. To me this team is an environment about experimenting and discovering those technologies: codifying generally intelligent computation and environmental understanding through environmental interaction.

Research
{: .label .label-yellow}

Hi, I am Shravani, and one of the i2 Fellows Leads and a Computer Science major at UW. Outside academics, I enjoy traveling, watching movies, and Sudoku. I joined Interactive Intelligence last year where I took the Intro Course, TAed for it, and participated in i2 Fellows. Being a part of i2 was a great learning opportunity, and I am excited to be on the research leadership this year.

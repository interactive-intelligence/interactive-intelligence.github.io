Neuroscience Lead
{: .label .label-blue }

Hello! I’ve long been fascinated in how neural circuits direct how our brains make sense of everchanging data in a complex world. These thoughts are translated into behaviors that govern an individual’s entire quality of life; therefore, to understand how a single behavior arises, it is key to have an in-depth grasp of how our electrical signals propagate through the nervous system and process information. Specifically, my interest is utilizing computational methods to mimic the way the human brain operates to recognize patterns and solve common problems in the fields of neuroscience, AI, ML, and DL.

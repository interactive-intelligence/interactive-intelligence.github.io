I'm interested in the bidirectional relationship between neuroscience and AI: how neural network models can be improved with our understanding of how the brain works, and how AI's computing power can be harnessed to advance neuroscience research. Precision medicine, nutrition, and creative writing are also fascinating, I enjoy playing badminton, skiing, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/87840794-eric-xia), and I'm trying to learn guitar. I love meeting new people, feel free to reach out. :)

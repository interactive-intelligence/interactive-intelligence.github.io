Hey there! I’m Andre. I work on philosophy and computer science at the University of Washington. I am interested in exploring the epistemology of deep learning algorithms, particularly with respect to ‘deep pedagogy’, adaptive curriculum design, and the potential of such models to develop subjectivity, disagreement, opinions, and bias. *If there are any problems with the site, please email me or contact me on Discord.*

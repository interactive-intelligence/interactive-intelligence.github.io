Hey there! I’m Andre. I work on philosophy and computer science at the University of Washington. I am interested in exploring the epistemology of deep learning algorithms, particularly with respect to ‘deep pedagogy’, adaptive curriculum design, and the potential of such models to develop subjectivity, disagreement, opinions, and bias. The relationship between theoretical and inductive (‘practical’) discoveries in deep learning and AI ethics and regulation also interests me. Previously, I built deep computer vision models for medical pathology at the Najafian Lab. Currently, I am researching a novel data annotation protocol at the Social Futures Lab. I am set to join the philosophy department for research on Bayesianism in ML algorithms in Winter. *If there are any problems with the site, please email me.*

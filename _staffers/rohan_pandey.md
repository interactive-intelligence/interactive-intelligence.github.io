Very passionate math nerd always eager to learn! Currently a third year majoring in ACMS (Sci. Comp. & Num. Alg.) and minoring in (A)MATH, and Neural Computation and Engineering. Love playing tennis so feel free to reach out if ever interested to play together! Huge car and watch geek and I love talking about them. From 4:30 am (don't ask why) I am ready to engage in my passionate areas which is composed of researching mathematical models for cancer stability, playing around with LLMs, and building and flying large scaled rockets!

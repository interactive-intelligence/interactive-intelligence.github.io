I'm interested in neural-inspired computing and computational models of higher-level cognitive processes. Outside of my work, I like to draw, play tabletop RPGs, and read sci-fi. Fun fact: if you've taken CSE 142 sometime in the past 3 years, I may have been your TA! [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yawnitis/){:target="_blank"}

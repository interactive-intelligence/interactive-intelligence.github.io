Hi, I'm Frank, a full-time CS student, and part-time SWE & researcher. My interests fluctuates a lot but I'm currently into intelligent agents and systems development. Took a bunch of courses and worked in couple research labs at UW doing DL-related things. Now focused on finding peace of mind and area of focus for a potential PhD. In my free time, I workout, play games, and tinker with trending open-source projects. Feel free to reach out.

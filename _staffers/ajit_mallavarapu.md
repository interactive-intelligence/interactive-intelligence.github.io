NeuroAI Ethics Vanguard
{: .label .label-yellow}

I am a sophomore pursuing a degree in Informatics with a concentration in Data Science and a minor in Statistics. I am interested in applying machine/deep learning to various sectors and learning about the implications of Artificial Intelligence. Outside of academia, I enjoy playing/watching many sports and spending time with my family.

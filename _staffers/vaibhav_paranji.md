Education
{: .label .label-yellow}

Hello! My name is Vaibhav, and I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science. I am excited to be a part of I2, where I will be one of your TAs, in addition to doing any miscellaneous work around this club! I joined this club because of the warm community that is in its place, and it has been an incredible experience so far. Outside of academics and club activities, I enjoy watching sports, scrolling my phone and hanging out with friends. I am passionate about Artificial Intelligenceâ€™s potential positive impacts and trying to figure out ways to use AI while minimizing its negative aspects. I look forward to contributing to I2 and making a positive impact. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat!

Hi, I’m Pushpesh! I’m majoring in CS and am in my 2nd year at UW. I joined i2 in my first year, and it helped me build foundational knowledge in the fields of AI and aspects of machine learning. In my spare time, I love to play the piano and play/watch pretty much any sport (mainly soccer, football, and basketball).

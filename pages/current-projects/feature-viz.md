# Feature Visualization
{: .no_toc }

Replicating Feature Visualization with Pytorch
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Project Leadership
**Project Manager:** Winston Zhang
- Contact: *wz73@uw.edu*

## Description
This project uses the ideas presented in the article Feature Visualization and reimplements them with pytorch. Currently the colab files attached to the article do not run, and given that it is an article that's been cited a lot it would be a benefit to users if the examples provided could execute in colab. Additionally, it would be useful to run it using a more widely used library (Pytorch) in order to increase readability. 

## Alignment with I2
Adds to the artificial intelligence community.

## Garbage Collection

### RL Goals
- Have unit tests, documentation, and models running by the end of April

### Network Splitting
- Growing neural network - start from null to initialization, followed by repeated iteration. 
- Performs much worse than a standard neural network for now, but trying classification vs autoencoding.

### Environment
- Doing well

### Emergent Language
- Good results so far
- Good philosophical grounding
- Expect to get something 'paper-publishable' by end of the quarter

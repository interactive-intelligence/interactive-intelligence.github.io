### Predictive Coding


### Swarm Intelligence
- Swarm intelligence: you don't want a central controller of many individual things, rather - give autonomy to the individual agents and have them converge to certain optimal solutions.
- When you have many different agents, coordinating all the actions at once is difficult.
- We hope that agents converge to a solution and do what we want - potentially risky. No guaranteed behavior.
- Real-world applications. We need to think about potential challenges.
- Swarm control is generally used in the military for drone. Applications often involve robotics.
- Biological analogs - bees, ant colonies, schools of fish, society, immune system, artificial immune systems, slime molds.
  - Move together, but without a central controller.
- Fungal computing. Fungal colonies are simultaneously a mass of single-celled fungi and a massive unicellular organismm.
  - Fungal cells can propagate electrical signals, which allows for the processing of Boolean logic. 
  - Biological computing - a lot of interesting properties.
- Fungus is alive - it perceives in the same way that organisms do, respond to physical inputs naturally. Allows the building to 'make decisions' based on changes in lighting, air quality, physical damage, etc.
- Give autonomy to individuals in a swarm: abstracts low-level control and reduces computational demands of a central controller.
- Self-driving vehicles. Traffic is a complex system consisting of many independent agents.
- A central computer cannot compute the goals and surrounding states of all of the states in a system. Swarm computing becomes more relevant. Individual agents with only their internal state and surrounding observations can cooperate to achieve a goal.

### Biologically Informed/Plausible Networks
- Biologically plausible networks - networks that can perform their function in a way that could plausibly be done by biological systems.
  - Backpropagation not bio-plausible (?) because information cannot be rapidly sent antidromically from neuron synapses.
  - Following Hebbian plasticity rules
- Neural networks are a few abstractions away from the brain.
- We can approximate the behavior or outcome of modified 'brains' through reconstruction of a state.
- Heavily relationship to neuroscience
- Being biological plausible allows us to get closer to emulate the brain
- We can perform "unethical" experiments on bio-plausible networks
- Significant literature on 'plausifying' training algorithms.
- Numenta: shifting for a biological rather than a mathematical basis for AI algorithms
- Jeff Hawkins, *A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence*
- More of a recent phenomenon in literature
- MemoryNet: through only feed-forward and local updates, efficiently encoding information into a NN structured like a section of the brain
- Complex Behavior from Smaller Systems. Use a bio-informed paradigm/architectural design to create smaller networks that show higher learning abilities for NNs of the same size.

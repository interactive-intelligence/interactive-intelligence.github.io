## Notes
### Characteristics of Intelligence
- Creativity (what is creativity)?
  - Procedural
  - Randomness - creativity
  - Novelty of strategy
  - Abstractions
- Meta-knowledge, self-identity, self actualization
- Organisms do not necessarily take immediate action for their survival
- Trauma and intelligence - trauma has been shown to impedede brain structure. 
- Is intelligence static? Can smart people be dumb in the moment?
- Is intelligence a scale - a ball - how many dimensions?
- Transferability across environments
- Parasites and hijacking
- Replika
- Servitude, *Race After Technology*
- Relating to the human brain
- Anticipating or forecasting consequences or rewards.
- intelligence - using the enviornment around us to benefit ourselves - correlation with intelligence
- Parasites - get into hosts and change the structure of the brain or the body to benefit themselves.
- Communication and intelligence

### Projects
- We're a project-based club!
- Goals - learning, presenting about topics we know about, designing, principles that govern what we want to mkae
- Member Expectations
  - Let's actually do stuff!
  - Projects and tasks - if you are assigned to do a task and you have difficulties, be communicative - inform people and communicate!
- We still have a lot to learn - we don't know exactly where to go with a project.
- We will identify topics we want to identify and research more deeply in groups of 2 to 3 people.
- Brainstorming topics that we might want to do those presentations on.

#### Project Suggestions
- Libraries available for us to use
- Biologically plausible neural networks
  - Spiking neural networks
- Biologically/neurologically informed neural networks/computational structures
- Swarm intelligence
- Simulated training for robotics/reinforcement learning settings - translation into the physical world.
- Cybernetic enhancement - using neural networks to enhance the properties of biological entities.

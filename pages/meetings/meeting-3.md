## Deliverables
Based on the form interest, the following research groups have been created:

| Topic | People |
| --- | --- |
| Biologically Informed/Plausible Networks | Drew, Chanh |
| Reinforcement Learning | Varun, Aditya, Timothy |
| Neuromorphic Computing Hardware | Yegor, Chris |
| Swarm Intelligence/Robots/Coded Agents | Ary, Jason, Chaytan |
| Meta-Modeling and Self-Aware Networks | Sabrina, Marlene, Andre |
| Neuroscience of Predictive Coding & Memory | Janna, Jay, Alec |

Next meeting, each group will give an informal presentation sharing their research. *If you want to be involved in another topic, let us know and we'll add you!*

### Presentation Guidelines & Objectives
You will research a given topic in small interdisciplinary groups, then give a small presentation on what you learned. The idea is to discover what experts are doing in your topic/field, and where our team may be able to add value through our own project. 
 
| Use whatever form of creating slides works best for you - Canva, Google Slides, PowerPoint - your choice. |

Touch on the following questions, not necessarily in this order:
- How does this topic relate to the idea of intelligence
  - Does it have neuroscience ties? Computer science ties? Other related fields in which it is relevant? (These ties are not requirements for the topic, just an open question.)
- What are some interesting recent papers, projects, or advances in this topic?
- What are at least 2 project ideas or directions that would build upon the progress of this field?
- Any libraries/technologies required/could help with implementation?
- What do we need to know more about to better understand this topic?

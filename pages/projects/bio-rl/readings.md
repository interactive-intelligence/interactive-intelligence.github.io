##RL Algorithms
["Policy Gradient"]&#40;https://towardsdatascience.com/an-intuitive-explanation-of-policy-gradient-part-1-reinforce-aa4392cbfd3c{:target="_blank"} Article by Adrien Lucas Ecoffet on the math behind the loss and update rule for policy gradient.
["Policy Gradient"]&#40;https://towardsdatascience.com/policy-gradients-in-a-nutshell-8b72f9743c5d{:target="_blank"} Article by Sanyam Kapoor, another helpful explanation of the math of policy gradient algorithms.
["Policy Gradient and Actor Critic"]&#40;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRfUxQs6xIM{:target="_blank"} A fantastic lesson by Hado Van Hasselt of Deepmind on all things Actor Critic and RL.
["PyTorch Actor Critic"]&#40;https://github.com/hermesdt/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/a2c/cartpole_a2c_online.ipynb;{:target="_blank"} By Github user hermesdt: Code we followed to create our own variants of Actor Critic methods with OpenAI gym.
["Trust Region Policy Optimization"]&#40;https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/rl-trust-region-policy-optimization-trpo-explained-a6ee04eeeee9{:target="_blank"} By Jonathan Hui: an intuitive explanation of Trust Region Policy Optimization.

##Neuroscience
["A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence"]&#40;https://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Brains-New-Theory-Intelligence/dp/1541675819{:target="_blank"} By Jeff Hawkins of Numenta, explaining his theory of cognition and cortical columns.
["Models of the Mind"]&#40;https://www.amazon.com/Models-Mind-Engineering-Mathematics-Understanding/dp/1472966422{:target="_blank"} By Grace Lindsay, a tour of the mathematical models most useful to computational neuroscience when describing the brain.

[comment]: <> (- ["Emergence of Grounded Compositional Language in Multi-Agent Populations"]&#40;https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04908&#41;{:target="_blank"} by Igor Mordatch, Pieter Abbeel. Mordatch and Abbeel demonstrate the emergence of a language with relevant, materially grounded noun, adjective, and verb symbols from a simple reinforcement learning multi-agent collaboration task.)

[comment]: <> (  - See slides from a [JC presentation]&#40;https://interactive-intelligence.github.io/jc/win2022/meeting-3#emergence-of-grounded-compositional-language-in-multi-agent-populations&#41;{:target="_blank"} given on this paper.)

[comment]: <> (- ["On the Spontaneous Emergence of Discrete and Compositional Signals"]&#40;https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.433.pdf&#41;{:target="_blank"} by Nur Geffen Lan, Emmanuel Chemla, Shane Steinert-Threlkeld. Lan et al. demonstrate that a signalling language games can be understood as an autoencoder problem and demonstrate that discrete messages naturally arise within these messages from training autoencoders in such contexts.)

[comment]: <> (- ["Learning Emergent Discrete Message Communication for Cooperative Reinforcement Learning"]&#40;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12550.pdf&#41;{:target="_blank"} by Sheng Li, Yutai Zhou, Ross Allen, Mykel J. Kochenderfer. )

[comment]: <> (- ["Compositional Observer Communication Learning from Raw Visual Input"]&#40;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02341v1.pdf&#41;{:target="_blank"} by Edward Choi, Angeliki Lazaridou, Nando de Freitas.)

[comment]: <> (- ["An Improvement for Capsule Networks using Depthwise Separable Convolution"]&#40;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15167v1.pdf&#41; by Nguyen Huu Phong, Bernardete Ribeiro.)

[comment]: <> (  - Looking into using this as our visual unit for Siamese architecture.)

[comment]: <> (Computational Linguistics)

[comment]: <> (- ["Determining Compositionality of Word Expressions Using Various Word Space Models and Measures"]&#40;https://aclanthology.org/W13-3208.pdf&#41;{:target="_blank"})

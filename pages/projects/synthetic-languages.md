# Synthetic Languages

Allowing AI populations to independently develop a language for optimal communication
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Language is fundamental to collective human intelligence. Moreover, anthropology studies have demonstrated that the development of language may have been a key factor responsible for rapidly increasing the rate of human civilization's advancement. Our language is an intricate and complex system of symbols arranged sequentially to communicate meaning. Many efforts have been made to advanced machine understanding of human language. However, these deep learning models learn by modeling syntactic representations - associations and contexts between sets of linguistic tokens - rather than necessarily comprehending the semantics behind language. A network perceives the word 'stone' as related to 'rock' and perhaps even to 'boulder', as something that is often the noun upon which the verb 'skip' is acted upon, and so on: but it does not understand the physical, visual, or other sensory properties of a stone. The detatchment of language models from the semantic roots of language is one key reason behind their observed lack of robustness.

The objective of this project is not to force machines to understand the syntactics of human language, but rather to encourage the development of a synthetic language between AI agents in relationship to an environment.

Phases:
1. Train and evaluate computational linguistics approaches on a modified VQ-VAE
2. Modify Mordatch & Abbeel's "emergent language" environment
3. Train on a predator-prey environment for adversarial language development

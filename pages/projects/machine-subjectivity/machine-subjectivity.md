We are a close-knit community of writers and readers discussing topics in the philosophy of deep learning. Currently we are reading *On the Existence of Digital Objects* by Yuk Hui. Members can access the PDFs [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14eLdZmvNeYVRvrB6EcdX18Fs9-mbzxua?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. We meet on Tuesdays at 4:30 PM in Savery Hall (join Discord for details).

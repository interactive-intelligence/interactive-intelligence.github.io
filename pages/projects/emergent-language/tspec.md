## Properties of Language

This section describes various properties of language we hope to see demonstrated by the created synthetic language. The first three ({discrete, sequential, variable-length}) are explicitly built into the design of the architecture, the remainder are metrics that may have auxiliary or indirect effect on the model.

### Discrete

### Sequential

### Variable-Length

### Grounded

### Compositional

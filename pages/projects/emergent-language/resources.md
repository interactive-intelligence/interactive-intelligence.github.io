- ["Emergence of Grounded Compositional Language in Multi-Agent Populations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04908){:target="_blank"} by Igor Mordatch, Pieter Abbeel. Mordatch and Abbeel demonstrate the emergence of a language with relevant, materially grounded noun, adjective, and verb symbols from a simple reinforcement learning multi-agent collaboration task.
  - See slides from a [JC presentation](https://interactive-intelligence.github.io/jc/win2022/meeting-3#emergence-of-grounded-compositional-language-in-multi-agent-populations){:target="_blank"} given on this paper.
- ["On the Spontaneous Emergence of Discrete and Compositional Signals"](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.433.pdf){:target="_blank"} by Nur Geffen Lan, Emmanuel Chemla, Shane Steinert-Threlkeld. Lan et al. demonstrate that a signalling language games can be understood as an autoencoder problem and demonstrate that discrete messages naturally arise within these messages from training autoencoders in such contexts.
- ["Learning Emergent Discrete Message Communication for Cooperative Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12550.pdf){:target="_blank"} by Sheng Li, Yutai Zhou, Ross Allen, Mykel J. Kochenderfer. 
- ["Compositional Observer Communication Learning from Raw Visual Input"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02341v1.pdf){:target="_blank"} by Edward Choi, Angeliki Lazaridou, Nando de Freitas.

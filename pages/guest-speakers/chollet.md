# Francois Chollet

Finals Week, Date TBD
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }


## Brief Background
Fran√ßois Chollet is a artificial intelligence researcher currently working at Google. Most famously, Chollet is the creator of the deep-learning library Keras, and is a main contributor to TensorFlow. His research focuses on computer vision and the application of machine learning to formal reasoning, abstraction, generality. Chollet graduated with a Master of Engineering from the ENSTA Paris school in 2012 and started working at Google in 2015. His papers have been published at major conferences in the field. He authored the paper *Xception: Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions*, a groundbreaking paper in the development of deep learning computer vision work. In 2021, Chollet was awarded the Global Swiss AI Award for his work advancing Artificial Intelligence.

We are incredibly honored that Chollet will be coming to visit I2 at the University of Washington during finals week of spring quarter. We will host a general Q&A with him, centering on his most recent paper, "On the Measure of Intelligence", and the associated Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenge, as well as other topics.

See the [Spring Quarter Week 7 JC](https://interactive-intelligence.github.io/jc/spr2022/meeting-7) for an overview on "On the Measure of Intelligence" and the ARC.

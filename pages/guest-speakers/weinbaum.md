## Brief Background
Alys Weinbaum is a professor in the University of Washington's English department, with research and teaching interests in feminist theory, Black studies, Marxist theory, modern and contemporary transatlantic literature and culture, and reproductive cultures and politics. Her most recent book, *The Afterlife of Reproductive Slavery: Human Reproduction in Biocapitalism* (Duke University Press, 2019), investigates Atlantic slaveryâ€™s reflection in and refraction through the cultures and politics of human reproduction that characterize late 21st century capitalism. The book argues that slavery lives on through a racial and economic calculus, or slave episteme, and that black feminism produced in the 1970s, 80s and 90s constitutes a specifically black feminist philosophy of history that reveals reproductive slavery's afterlife. *The Afterlife of Reproductive Slavery* is a companion to *Wayward Reproductions: Genealogies of Race and Nation in Transatlantic Modern Thought* (Duke UP, 2004), which treats intersecting ideas about human reproduction, race, and racial nationalism expressed in major nineteenth and early twentieth century thought-systems such as first wave feminism, classical Marxism, Freudian psychoanalysis, Darwinian evolutionary theory, and various forms of anti-racism and anti-imperialism. Weinbaum is currently working to complete this trilogy with a book on dystopic representations of reproductive power in contemporary literature and film. Weinbaum has won many awards, including the Distinguished Undergraduate Teaching Award by the UW Department of English, the 2019 Sarah A. Whaley Book Prize by the National Women's Studies Association, and the 2019 Gloria E. Anzaldua Book Prize by the National Women's Studies Association.

Although we are an Artificial Intelligence student group, we have asked Professor Weinbaum to have a discussion under the belief that these spheres of thought should be more often in contact and overlap with one another. We recognize that we work in a field possessing one of the highest concentrations of capital and power in the modern age. Thus, we invite our members to think outside the self-isolating sphere of our world - the metaphysics and epistemologies we take for granted that may not be in tune with the broader world - even if it is uncomfortable. The purpose of this discussion is to increase awareness and to engage with novel ideas that may affect how we think about and conduct our work, present and future. We are deeply grateful to Professor Weinbaum for supporting and guiding this process.

In this discussion, we will discuss the *Black Mirror* episode TBD, which discusses TBD.

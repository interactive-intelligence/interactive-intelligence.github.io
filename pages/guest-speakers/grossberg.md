# Stephen Grossberg

Monday, 4/18/22
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

| We are extremely honored to announce that we will host Stephen Grossberg, a founder of the fields of theoretical psychology and cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and biologically-inspired technology as our speaker for Jounral Club on 4/18/22. |

## Brief Background

After becoming the first joint undergraduate major in mathematics and psychology at Dartmouth, and mathematics as a PhD student at Stanford and Rockefeller, he became an assistant professor and taught applied mathematics at MIT while he continiued to discover and develop neural models of how brains make minds. Unlike Grossberg, most did not believe in this mysterious domain of "computational neuroscience" in the 1970s.

Grossberg next  moved to Boston University, whose President and Provost believed in his vision and awarded him an endowed Chair in cognitive and neural systems. There, he established the Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems, which he and many gifted colleagues developed into the world's leading graduate department that theoretically explains how brains make minds, carries out experiments to test these explanations and predictions, and applies these insights to applications in engineering, technology, and AI. He is the foundational architect of the field and most of his work relates to what we do at Interactive Intelligence. In particular, his models help to explain essentially all the fundamental brain processes that make us human and provide a blueprint for an AI with human-level intelligence.

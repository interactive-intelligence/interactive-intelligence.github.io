# Journal Club

Journal Club meetings are held every week. See the schedules page for the most recent information on our schedules. JC meetings allow members to share, learn about, and discuss literature - both classic/foundational and novel/innovative - from neuroscience and artificial intelligence. See the JC meeting notes for resources and links to the presented literature and discussion.

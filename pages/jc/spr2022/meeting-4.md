We are extremely honored to announce that our club will have Stephen Grossberg, a founder of the field of computational neuroscience, as our guest speaker for Journal Club on 4/18/22. 

**Brief background.** After studying psychology at Dartmouth and mathematics at Stanford, Grossberg became an assistant professor and taught applied mathematics at MIT. Unlike Grossberg, most did not believe in this mysterious domain of "computational neuroscience" in the 1970s. Grossberg eventually moved to Boston University where two faculty members believed in his vision; there, he established the Department of Cognitive and Neural System, which is now synonymous with computational neuroscience. He is the foundational architect of this field and most of his work relates to what we do at Interactive Intelligence.

He discovered widely used equations including what is now known as the Hopfield model, Adaptive Resonance Theory (introduced in 1976, this is perhaps the first predictive coding theory), equations for short/medium/long term memory + neuronal activation, and many more. Please check out his Wikipedia page and personal [site](https://sites.bu.edu/steveg/){:target="_blank"}

He also won many international awards, including the 2015 Norman Anderson Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society of Experimental Psychologists, the 2017 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Frank Rosenblatt Award, the 2019 Donald O. Hebb award from the International Neural Network Society, and the 2022 PROSE book award in Neuroscience from the Association of American Publishers etc.

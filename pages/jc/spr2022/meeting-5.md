This week, we took a break from our regularly scheduled Journal Club content and instead debated the following question.

> *Are trees or humans better?*

Many arguments were raised in favor of trees being better and in favor of humans being better.

**Proposition: Trees are better (than humans).**
- Chaytan add stuff here

**Proposition: Humans are better (than trees).**
- Humans are conscious, trees are not. We hold a 'strict'/undiluted definition of consciousness, which requires abstraction and self-actualization (among other properties).
- The concept of betterness emerges from a system of ethics and morality. Ethics and morality are contained within consciousness; that is, there is no basis for the existence of ethics and morality without consciousness - they are formulated from and in terms of a conscious being. To apply concepts of betterness and worseness to unconscious objects while attempting to detach human conscious influence is invalid. Therefore, humans are beter because betterness applies only to consciousness. This is a subcase of the statement "conscious things are better than unconscious things".
- (Unrigorous) Betterness is dependent on value. If you value an object $$A$$ more than an object $$B$$, then if you are given the choice to only keep one of $${A, B}$$, you will choose to keep $$A$$ while discarding $$B$$. You are presented with a human and a tree. You keep one alive, and kill the other. *Most people* (apparently not the pro-tree folks at the meeting) would choose the human, thus demonstrating value judgement and judgement of betterness.

In this Journal Club, we were honored to talk with Cortical Labs founder Dr. Hon Weng Chong about their progress building biological computing chips. These chips grow neurons from stem cells on electrode arrays. With this technology, they were able to use their "dishbrain" to learn to play the video game Pong!

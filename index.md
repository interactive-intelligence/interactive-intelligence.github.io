# I2: Interactive Intelligence
{: .mb-2 .text-green-000}

Fusing neuroscience and AI to study intelligent computational systems
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

I2 is an environment which aims to create a community of project-driven, outcome-oriented students at the University of Washington interested in the intersections of reinforcement learning, embodied artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. Our goal is to make machines learn like humans.
